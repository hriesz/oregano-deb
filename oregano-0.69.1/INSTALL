Installation Names
==================

   By default, `scons install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `scons' the
option `PREFIX=PATH'.

   You can also change the destination directory by giving 'scons'
the option 'DESTDIR=PATH' .
